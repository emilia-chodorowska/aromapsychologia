1
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:08,360
[Music] The

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,440
next problem we'll be

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:16,480
dealing with today, and we'll

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:20,400
also be introducing other topics later, is

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,840
the epidemiology of brain diseases, right?  so

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,560
what problems with our central

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,279
nervous system, although as

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,439
I said, today we are also increasingly

9
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,320
focusing our attention on the

10
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,079
peripheral nervous system and the

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,680

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,239
polyphagal theory, which I also talked a lot about a moment ago, has

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,399
also given us a lot in this aspect.

14
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,680
So what problems occur

15
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,039
most often here?  As I said, these are

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,719
brain diseases, because I also use

17
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:50,120
literature on brain diseases, but

18
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,559
I will constantly remind you that

19
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,640
if we are talking about

20
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:57,079
anxiety disorders or depression today, we should also be

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,840
interested in the peripheral

22
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:02,359
nervous system, because sometimes its role is

23
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,119
significant here, so

24
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:09,080
for example, if the axis of the brain does not work

25
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,600
and we have, let's say, a low mood.  I mean, it does

26
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:15,520
n't work, it always works, but it's

27
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:17,200
the information transmitted from

28
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,200
our digestive tract, and

29
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,240
today we're talking about the jito

30
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,439
microbiota-brain axis, so let's assume the composition of

31
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,280
our intestinal microbiota, that can

32
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:28,720
determine how we feel

33
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,360
mentally, right?  And what follows from this in

34
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,399
practical terms for us is that, of course,

35
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:36,479
 

36
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:39,880
we can use psychobiotics in the treatment of

37
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,240
mood disorders or other types of

38
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,280
mental disorders.  So this is something that is

39
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,799
emerging today as more and

40
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:51,360
more popular knowledge, because it is,

41
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:54,079
of course, the result of current research.

42
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,680
Currently, science is exploring the topic of the

43
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,680
gut-brain axis extensively

44
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,200
, but it

45
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,960
also has specific practical implications,

46
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,759
right?  So we are increasingly reaching for

47
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,680
tools that modulate the

48
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,560
digestive tract microbiota or

49
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,040
tools that modulate the functioning of the

50
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:15,519
digestive tract to deal with the

51
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,720
nervous system and vice versa.  Yes,

52
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:21,239
so here

53
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:23,760
we can also, for example, through

54
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:26,200
relaxation techniques, have a positive impact on the

55
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,800
functioning of our

56
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,680
digestive tract.  Brain diseases are among the

57
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,280
most

58
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,800
socially and economically burdensome diseases in Europe

59
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,959
.  This has been talked about for

60
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,879
many years.  E, and some

61
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:42,159
historical numerical data

62
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:45,560
to show the broader background.  For

63
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:47,239
example, in 2010, 179 million

64
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,519
Europeans suffered from

65
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:51,560
brain diseases, while six years earlier it was

66
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:55,040
127 million, when we see very

67
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:57,560
significant progress.  In this particular case, the

68
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,440
values ​​mean an increase in disease incidence over

69
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:05,400
6 years by approximately 40%.  This is a

70
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:07,680
lot.  Among brain diseases, more than 60% of the

71
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,680
social and economic costs

72
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,319
are generated by mental disorders.

73
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,239
Generally, brain diseases can be

74
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:16,200
divided into mental disorders and

75
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,560
neurological problems, right?  So we have

76
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:21,519
psychiatry and neurology.

77
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,360
However, when it comes to

78
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,280
mental disorders themselves, the

79
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,400
most common problem here is the

80
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:32,159
occurrence of anxiety disorders.  And in

81
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,840
second place are depression and

82
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:38,840
mood disorders.

83
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:40,439
Here is a schematic summary of

84
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,040
various

85
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:46,000
brain diseases in Europe in

86
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,959
2010,

87
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,920
in terms of numerical values, right?

88
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:55,799
So we have millions of people

89
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,200
affected by a given clinical problem.  And please

90
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:01,920
pay attention to

91
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:04,439
which bars are most

92
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,799
marked here.  Yes, so we have

93
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:09,760
anxiety disorders and this is the

94
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:10,920
highest numerical value.  In second

95
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,360
place is a

96
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:16,560
mental disorder, i.e. mental illness.

97
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,199
Then we have migraines.  Migraine headaches

98
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,320
are the most common

99
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:22,720
neurological problem.  And we still have

100
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,199
mood disorders.  This group, of course,

101
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,880
includes depression, addictions, and

102
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,039
dependencies.  Another clinical problem

103
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,240
is dementia,

104
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:34,400
psychotic disorders, epilepsy, but as

105
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,400
I said earlier, epilepsy

106
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:41,039
is a symptom that can accompany

107
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,560
various types of brain diseases.  Strokes,

108
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:46,280
some

109
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,880
brain injuries, Parkinson's disease,

110
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,400
multiple sclerosis and

111
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,080
 

112
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,560
brain tumors.  Of course, all of this generates

113
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,120
costs, and we see that these costs

114
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,720
are especially high when it comes to mood disorders

115
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,479
 

116
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:06,000
and dementia.  Dementia can be

117
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:08,320
caused by Alzheimer's disease, because

118
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,039
you can also see here that

119
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,919
Alzheimer's disease is not mentioned,

120
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:16,400
but it is here in the background of this

121
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:18,240
dementia.  Yes, so the most common

122
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,880
cause of

123
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,060
dementia is age-related.  is

124
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:27,259
Alzheimer's disease.

125
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,259
[Music]

126
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:33,720
And here is the literature source for this

127
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,759
information.

128
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,520
Well, this is a simplification, a comparison,

129
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,280
right?  One in three people in Europe will suffer from a

130
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:44,199
mental or neurological disorder

131
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:46,560
during their lifetime.  1/3, right?  So,

132
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:50,840
uh, the frequency of brain diseases

133
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:53,440
is really quite high.  Um, and

134
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,720
this is a simplified summary of the basic

135
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,240
brain diseases, the most common ones, as

136
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,880
I said earlier,

137
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:03,800
mental and neurological diseases are the two

138
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,160
basic types of diseases.  And here in

139
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,599
mental illnesses we are talking about

140
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,720
anxiety disorders,

141
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:09,880
mood disorders, including depression, and

142
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,599
psychotic disorders are also

143
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,919
included here.  And neurological diseases are

144
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:14,960
diseases of the cerebrovascular system.  We mentioned

145
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:19,160
that the most common problem is

146
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:22,160
migraine, but also other primary

147
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,680
headaches, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease

148
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,960
and other dementias, other

149
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,199
neurodegenerative diseases such as

150
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:34,120
multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease, but these

151
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:36,840
occur much less frequently.  Here we have a

152
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:41,000
table showing the numerical values ​​for

153
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:44,360
Poland.  Here, in 2019,

154
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,520
brain diseases in Poland affected 15 million

155
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:50,120
people.  And again we see the arrows.  Even

156
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:52,160
here I have numbered the individual

157
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,680
rows and tables to make it clear and

158
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,759
understandable.  Anxiety disorders are the

159
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:00,759
most important.  Yes, over 5 million

160
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:04,639
Poles had anxiety disorders in 2019

161
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:07,520
.  In second place is a

162
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:10,440
neurological disorder, i.e. migraine.  When it comes

163
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:13,000
to mental disorders,

164
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,720

165
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,479
mood disorders come second after anxiety disorders.  And we still have

166
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,720
addictions.  And we see that

167
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,720
psychotic disorders are much

168
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,879
less common, right?  Strokes about the

169
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,800
same.  Here it's 453,

170
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:31,080
Alzheimer's disease

171
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,639
357 and we see rarer

172
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,879
neurodegenerative diseases.

173
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,759
Parkinson's disease twice as common as

174
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:41,199
multiple sclerosis.  This is the Polish

175
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,199
epidemiological situation.

176
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:49,560
And now we move on to the

177
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,159
therapeutic aspects, to aromatherapy,

178
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:57,240
so we know what this landscape looks like.

179
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:57,240
I

180
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,879
see here that Aha, there will be

181
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,440
newer ones later, because still with

182
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,599
individual disease entities,

183
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,800
because we have work and it will appear here,

184
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:12,039
when it comes to mood disorders,

185
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:16,960
it will be with depression,

186
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:19,400
because this 2019 brain report

187
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,960
is still up to date, because such studies are not often

188
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,599
done in Poland, but we have

189
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,639
other works. I will also refer to this

190
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:26,560
.

191
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,960
So now we move on to the

192
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,319
most common problems, namely

193
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,000
anxiety disorders.  But it's also like this:

194
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,919
on the one hand, we're talking about

195
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,800
disease entities, and on the other hand,

196
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:40,039
we're also talking about this broader context, right?

197
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:43,599
So it's not always the case that we have a

198
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:46,480
diagnosis of an anxiety disorder or PTSD,

199
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,040
but we have a problem, we have ailments

200
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,920
that we would like to

201
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:54,080
take care of in some way, right?  So we are at a

202
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:56,959
stage when we do not meet the

203
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,640
diagnostic criteria, but we can already

204
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,800
do something and this is what aromatherapy gives us.  Do

205
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,600
the changes that occur during migraine after

206
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,120
initiating effective pharmacotherapy

207
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,800
cause visible remissions in

208
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:11,079
brain structures?  We will talk about migraine

209
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:13,600
later, at our third

210
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:16,920
meeting.  However, it is also very common for

211
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:19,440
changes to occur in the

212
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,360
brain.  This is also particularly visible in

213
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,880
depression, because here we also have a lot of

214
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,800
neuroimaging studies, more and more,

215
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:29,079
so we can see these changes

216
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,160
in the context of, for example, the

217
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:33,800
increase in the volume of the hippocampus.  As

218
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,440
for migraines, I might expand on that

219
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,959
later, but I'll also check something out,

220
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:41,240
because I don't

221
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:43,760
recall any specific neuroimaging study related to this

222
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:46,720
 

223
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,240
that would be associated with effective

224
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,800
pharmacotherapy,

225
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:55,839
but that's also a matter of the type of migraine.

226
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,640
So we'll come back to this at our

227
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,360
next meeting.

228
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,519
Now we are in anxiety disorders,

229
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,959
which are the most common

230
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,279
mental illnesses.  Migraine is neurological

231
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:10,320
and we will talk about it in y two

232
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:12,200
weeks.

233
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,200
Such an active ingredient, very

234
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:17,240
commonly found in

235
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,480
essential oils, is the three most common

236
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,880
and recurring in various

237
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,360
essential oils.  This

238
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,000
includes linalool.  In second place,

239
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,959
meaning here in this set there is also

240
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,440
limonene and pinene.  These three are the kor

241
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:32,920
when it comes to what goes into our

242
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:35,120
body with

243
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:37,320
aromatherapy.

244
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,959
And now

245
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,560
how does this linelol work, which is one of the

246
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,680
most common ingredients

247
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,880
in essential oils.  This is also

248
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,560
immediate information for us.  If linalool

249
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,120
works in this way, and it is such a

250
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,079
common component of

251
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,760
essential oils, what does that mean for us

252
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:54,680
that we can very often

253
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,279
expect the effect that

254
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,720
linalool gives.  Yes, so of course it's not

255
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,440
that simple, but if we take

256
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,160
lavender, which contains two

257
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,040
basic, most important ingredients, they are

258
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,160
repeated in different chemotypes.

259
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,920
sometimes there is more lina lol, other

260
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,560
times there is more lina lil acetate, but

261
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,240
if we look at what is happening with the

262
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:16,079
linalool ocean in our brain, it turns out

263
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:18,320
, it turns out that the linalool osate

264
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,040
hydrolyzes and linalool is formed from it.

265
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,240
So lavender primarily provides us with

266
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,680
linalool, and how does this linalool

267
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,279
work?

268
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,880
how lavender works, which is the

269
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,800
most commonly used

270
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,680
essential oil in aromatherapy and has the most

271
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,880
clinical studies,

272
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:36,440
so it stimulates GABA receptors and has

273
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:39,279
anticonvulsive properties and we will also

274
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:41,519
illustrate this today.  yyy inhibits the

275
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:44,240
binding of

276
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,519
glutamic acid to receptors.  This

277
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,720
can also significantly affect

278
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:51,000
glutamatergic neurotransmission and that is

279
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,560
why lavender is not always

280
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,240
recommended if we want to improve

281
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,079
cognitive functions, because

282
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,519
glutamatergic neurotransmission

283
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,920
is important for cognitive functions and memory

284
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:04,639
.  it also inhibits the release of

285
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:06,519
acetylcholine and therefore it

286
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,600
is not the first choice.  Although

287
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:13,399
if we have cognitive disorders,

288
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,320
for example, some contexts related to

289
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,800
stress, then sometimes lavender can be

290
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,360
helpful, but this will be very

291
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,279
individual and if someone does not have this

292
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,399
stress component that is important in the

293
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,800
context of work,

294
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:27,519
working on various cognitive tasks, then we do

295
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,000
 

296
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,639
not choose lavender because it is not

297
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,959
our first choice of

298
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,399
oil, or other oils,

299
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:37,880
of course rich in Linal, because there are

300
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:38,920
obviously more of them and they have pain-relieving and

301
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,079

302
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:43,160
anti-inflammatory properties.  It is an aliphatic

303
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:44,880
monoterpene alcohol.  It is very

304
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:48,839
common.  Oils rich in linaru include,

305
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:52,040
for example, ho, or cinnamon leaf

306
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:54,680
.  Next, coriander seeds,

307
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:57,040
rosewood is also very rich.  Today

308
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:59,040
we have a problem with this raw material.

309
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,480
Thyme, but not any thyme,

310
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,120
absolutely not any.  It must be a

311
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:06,680
linoleic chemotype.  Linalool, right?  Well,

312
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,680
let's assume the thyme chemotype,

313
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:10,880
which we most often associate with, thyme will

314
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,519
not work for us here at all.

315
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:17,240
Neroli or of course lavender,

316
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:20,480
that is our combo lina lol odan lina

317
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:22,199
lilu and here is a table from Robert Ticerand

318
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,760
Hoł, that is what we said to

319
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:30,360
ourselves earlier so tree ho.  Next

320
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:32,199
we have rosewood, coriander seeds and

321
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,480
so on.  So this is a cheat sheet,

322
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:36,720
if anyone wants to go into great

323
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:39,480
detail about how much of this LOL is

324
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:42,720
present in various oils.  As

325
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:45,160
we can see, it is a large table.  There are

326
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,480
a lot of essential oils here because this

327
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:53,519
ingredient is a common

328
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:56,079
chemical compound.  In oils we have a

329
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,399
set of essential oils with

330
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:01,440
anti-anxiety properties.  It also

331
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,360
results from the fact that these oils are more often

332
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,720
used in research, for example.

333
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,560
We have this, let's call it,

334
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,759
clinical evidence, but aromatherapy practices

335
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,680
 

336
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:15,800
often simply take it into account.

337
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:19,199
Various authors, for example, use this in

338
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:22,880
their own approaches.  So this

339
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:25,639
is an original set, right?  It can

340
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,199
of course be expanded.  Um, lavender

341
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:30,440
is in first place because it

342
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:33,000
is the most used, most researched and

343
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:35,079
everyone knows about it.  Uh, orange,

344
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,440
sweet, citrus.  Overall, we have a whole

345
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:38,000
set of citrus fruits here.  Here,

346
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,440
lemon, neroli and

347
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,360
bergamot were mentioned.  Well, neroli

348
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,040
smells completely different than lemon or

349
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,480
orange,

350
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,040
but it is also often used in the

351
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,480
context of various problems with stress and

352
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:53,360
anxiety.

353
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,360
bergamot, such a delicate

354
00:14:54,680 --> 00:15:00,519
citrus oil, one could say lavender.   A

355
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:02,800
combination of citrus, citrus oil and

356
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:06,240
lavender.  Then ilang, ilang, or

357
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:08,480
kalange odorata.  and also a frequently

358
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,839
used and powerful oil in action.   It is

359
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:15,320
also often referred to as ilang, ilang,

360
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:17,000
i.e. this raw material, it too, this oil

361
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,240
can be very different

362
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,240
depending on what

363
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,720
type of distillation we are dealing with.

364
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,560
Is it complete, is it

365
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,320
extra, first, second, third phase of

366
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,839
distillation.  So if anyone has ever

367
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,880
smelled various ilang, ilang essential oils or

368
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:33,399
worked with them, they know exactly

369
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,839
what I am talking about.  it's also true that everyone

370
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:38,240
has their own preferences here,

371
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,079
because not everyone likes, for example, the

372
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,800
extra one, which is so very strong and

373
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:46,160
choking.  Then it is worth combining it with

374
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:48,600
something else.  However, the oil often

375
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,279
appears in research in the context of, for

376
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,279
example,

377
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:53,680
blood pressure.

378
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:55,360
It appears in clinical trials

379
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,720
when it comes to depression.  There isn't

380
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,240
much of it, but it does appear.  And we can

381
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,759
also find it somewhere in anxiety disorders

382
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,600
.  Lemongrass is the one further away that

383
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:04,319
is rarer.  Lemongrass

384
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,639
grapefruit for example grapefruit oil

385
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:07,959
was used in medical procedures,

386
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:09,759
damask rose

387
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:13,720
of course rosemary appears or

388
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:18,639
sage toloe fly.

389
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:20,720
Here is a table from a review paper

390
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,199
on the effects of essential oils on the

391
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:27,639
nervous system.  And in this table

392
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:29,360
we have, uh, attention paid to what

393
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:32,399
oils were used, what group of

394
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,880
patients, what was the dose.  Here

395
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:38,639
is the part about the dose, yes,

396
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:41,240
what effects were obtained, um, and the

397
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,800
references, yes, i.e. the

398
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:46,240
literature source.  And

399
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:48,480
here we have lavender.  We have the olfactory route of

400
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:52,360
lavender, but there is also an oral route.  And this

401
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:55,399
is a famous study from

402
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:58,480
2010 that showed the

403
00:16:55,399 --> 00:17:00,959
anti-anxiety properties of uh, lavender when taken

404
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:04,439
orally.  Three drops was a

405
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:08,160
large study, 200+ people, uh,

406
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:11,520
patients suffering from, uh,

407
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,760
anxiety disorders.  Here below we have a paper on

408
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,559
the use of

409
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:20,280
grapefruit oil in patients

410
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:23,240
who underwent colonoscopy

411
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:25,679
and it also turned out that there were

412
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:29,160
therapeutic benefits, a reduction in,

413
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:31,919
for example,

414
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,840
pain and abdominal discomfort, right?  Because of course

415
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:38,480
such ailments appear during

416
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:41,960
this procedure, right?  Here we have

417
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:45,440
geranium, yes, pelargonium, graveolens,

418
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:48,280
patients with

419
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,320
myocardial infraction, I don't remember

420
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:54,280
what it was.  It's obviously some kind of

421
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,280
heart problem, but

422
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,960
I'd have to check exactly what

423
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,960
this infraction is all about.

424
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,720
Maybe during the break.

425
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,880
And here we also have a reduced level of

426
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,400
anxiety.  Yes.  and each time an

427
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:14,120
anxiolytic effect, i.e. anti-anxiety,

428
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:17,200
but also anti-depressant.

429
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:19,799
Here is a collection of various works on

430
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:23,000
ilang oil, ilang, the calming and

431
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:25,919
anti-anxiety nature of this oil.  And

432
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,840
we also see olfactory stimulation again,

433
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:33,080
but also application to the skin.  Yes.  And uh

434
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,919
here uh we often see

435
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:37,679
antidepressant and anti-anxiety effects again.

436
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:40,760
However, other elements were often also studied here

437
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,919
, i.e. the effect on, for example,

438
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:46,320
blood pressure was studied.  Yes?  And in this table

439
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:50,039
we see the effects that the

440
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:53,360
blood pressure decreased, the pulse decreased, right?

441
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:55,640
That is, rate.

442
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,159
And this aspect of the impact on blood pressure comes up

443
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,679
often.  However, what

444
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:01,000
is important for us to remember from this

445
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:03,880
, there are healthy volunteers everywhere here

446
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,880
and of course I am not

447
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,880
discussing

448
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:27,720
whether you can hear now?

449
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,720
I hope you can hear me.

450
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,679
Okay, fine.

451
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,760
Heart attack.  Yes, this is cardial

452
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,799
infraction, just to make it clear

453
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:54,240
what I was talking about earlier.

454
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:57,480
And why am I talking about this?  because the

455
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:00,919
antihypertensive effectiveness of

456
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:03,679
inhalation aromatherapy is not high, it does not

457
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:08,799
replace pharmacotherapy.  Yes, so in

458
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:11,840
healthy people these effects are visible and

459
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:15,720
the studies included in the

460
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:18,000
table show this.  Um, but uh,

461
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,960
it's like this, if someone already has

462
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,720
hypertension, we don't expect

463
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:25,240
that if someone is going to smell, uh,

464
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,000
let's put some lavender and

465
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,320
neroli there, right?  This set was

466
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,360
used, among others, in

467
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,360
clinical trials, plus marjoram, um

468
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:35,640
, it will have a

469
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:39,400
hypotensive effect.  It will appear, but it is a

470
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:43,240
low hypotensive effect, right?  Up to 10

471
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:47,000
units, right?  but we won't

472
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:49,080
lower our blood pressure from 180 to 130,

473
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,640
for example systolic, so that's also

474
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:54,360
worth remembering.

475
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:57,159
But we come back to our anxiety disorders

476
00:20:54,360 --> 00:21:00,799
and to the works that used

477
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:03,080
lavender essential oils orally.  And this is

478
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:05,480
very interesting research.  They started around

479
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:08,240
2010 and since then there have been

480
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:11,679
many publications.  This job

481
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,840
is big, and the duration of 10 weeks is

482
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,360
also quite good, so it's not

483
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,480
short.  I mean, of course, it can be

484
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:20,799
discussed whether it is a short time, because cineol

485
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:22,840
has six months of research and that

486
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:26,039
is already quite a lot.  here 10

487
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:29,080
weeks, so we have two months,

488
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:30,760
but this is already something and, importantly, the

489
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:35,120
lavender oil preparation had a significant

490
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:38,679
beneficial effect on the quality and duration of sleep in the

491
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:41,120
group of people with anxiety disorders.

492
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:44,640
I haven't seen any studies yet, maybe there

493
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:46,919
are already some, showing whether, for example,

494
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,679
people with insomnia use

495
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:50,480
lavender oil, because insomnia can have

496
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:53,240
very different etiologies, and anxiety disorders don't always

497
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,120
co-occur. It's

498
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:58,520
highly probable that this effect will

499
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:02,240
also appear, that the quality of sleep

500
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:05,360
and sleep duration will be better, but we

501
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,360
don't have such evidence-based evidence yet.  This is

502
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,440
highly probable.  Such a

503
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,799
hypothesis can be formulated with certainty.   The

504
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,640
overall

505
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:15,120
mental and physical health improved without causing any

506
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,000
side effects, especially

507
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,240
excessive sedation or other

508
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,679
drug-specific effects.  Why are we talking

509
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,679
about this excessive respect?  Well, this is a

510
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:25,720
very basic topic when it comes to

511
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:28,159
the use of benzodiazepines, i.e.

512
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:30,240
drugs often used in the pharmacotherapy of

513
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,080
anxiety disorders.  Here the

514
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,640
drug preparation was used, which

515
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,679
is the name of the trade name.   An

516
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:40,039
80 mg dose of oil is about three

517
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:42,000
drops.  A drop is not a

518
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:44,760
precise measure.  I am talking about this because

519
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,360
in Poland we still do not have

520
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,640
a preparation, a

521
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:51,440
preparation of a medicinal nature.

522
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,679
Maybe some dietary supplements will appear

523
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,480
, because they are popping up like mushrooms after the rain,

524
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:58,880
so to speak.  However, this

525
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,799
is also practical information that we can

526
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,159
prepare a capsule with

527
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:05,440
lavender oil ourselves.

528
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:09,880
We make hydroxypropylcellulose capsules

529
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:12,039
on an ongoing basis, which means we use

530
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:13,400
some kind of base, oil, medium,

531
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:15,640
right?  It would be best if it was also a

532
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,840
functional oil.  It could be

533
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,679
sea buckthorn oil.  We don't need

534
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,799
large quantities because the capsule has a

535
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:25,400
small volume, so it's good to put

536
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:28,159
oil in it, which gives us a specific

537
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:31,240
effect in such a small dose.

538
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:33,039
And on top of that we put three drops of

539
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,159
lavender oil.  Can you do more?  You can do

540
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:37,320
more.  There is always a question here about

541
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:38,799
what else we use so that

542
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:42,520
interactions do not occur, because they are at

543
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:45,880
the forefront of the route to oral and oils.  Here it is absolutely

544
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:48,440
possible.

545
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:50,559

546
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,919
Oral lavender oil from lavender has a clinically significant

547
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:56,279
anxiolytic effect and alleviates

548
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:59,080
anxiety-related sleep disorders.  This is the

549
00:23:56,279 --> 00:24:01,440
only information we have from

550
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:04,320
this study and that is the work.  Here I

551
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:07,360
also have a slide prepared in

552
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:12,320
the times when PBM looked different.  it had a

553
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:15,200
different graphic design and here

554
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,880
the most important information is highlighted,

555
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,120
which was also presented on the

556
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,679
previous slide, but this research

557
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:24,240
was continued.  Here

558
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,600
is another work also from 2010.  6

559
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,559
weeks of taking lavender oil

560
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:32,080
orally, but in comparison with

561
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:35,279
benzodiazepines.  Here with lorazepam

562
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:38,240
for adults who had

563
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:42,440
generalized

564
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:46,159
anxiety disorder, or GAT for short.  Yyy and here

565
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:48,919
we have a clinical effect comparable to

566
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,760
benzodiazepines, right?  Um, when we look at the

567
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:53,240
results of this study, this one

568
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,880
was measured on the Hamilton Anxiety Severity Scale

569
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,640
.

570
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,159
Um, and we can see that, uh,

571
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:02,679
in both groups these effects were

572
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:06,000
very similar.  Here 45%

573
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:10,679
for the preparation with lavender oil.  And

574
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:16,360
uh here the impact on uh in terms of the

575
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:18,440
impact of gasoline was very similar 40 6%.

576
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:21,120
So, to sum up, we can

577
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:23,360
say here that oral lavender oil

578
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:26,200
is as effective

579
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:29,240
as Lora Zepam in adults with

580
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,679
generalized anxiety disorder.

581
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,480
However, we have the advantage of

582
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:36,799
lavender oil because there is no

583
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:39,760
sedative effect.  yyy but there was no such yyy

584
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:41,960

585
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:45,480
tendency towards addiction here, right?  So

586
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:48,960
we have uh clinical effectiveness and

587
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:52,960
at the same time good tolerance, which gives

588
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:56,159
us uh actually an alternative to

589
00:25:52,960 --> 00:26:01,039
benzodiazepines.  I think this is already a

590
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:01,039
very interesting result for us.

591
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:11,440
I hope the sound is okay.

592
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:13,399
Well, now we move further

593
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:17,000
forward.

594
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:19,320
Work is in progress.  Here it is 2024. And what did it turn

595
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,919
out to be?  That it turned out that we also have

596
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:24,360
antidepressant effects, that is, if

597
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:27,640
we have anxiety disorders,

598
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:29,520
then here they are

599
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:32,080
associated with depressive disorders,

600
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:36,600
then there are also effects here.

601
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:39,520
It's possible, and this time they

602
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:42,679
compared it

603
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:46,200
with, I think, paroxetine. Do we see

604
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:49,080
this information here about lorazepam,

605
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:52,919
paroxetine, or sertraline? This is an

606
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:54,600
SSRI,

607
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:57,000
but

608
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,720
this is probably a comparison of various

609
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,320
clinical studies, and

610
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:06,279
this table is taken from this publication, which

611
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:10,320
shows us various studies

612
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:12,840
where lavender oil was used.

613
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:16,440
Here was the number of patients, the time period: 10

614
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:18,640
weeks, 10 weeks, 10 weeks,

615
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,679
and I see that everywhere it says 10

616
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,440
weeks, but there were also

617
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:25,039
comparisons with

618
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,960
psychiatric medications.  Yes, here we have it with

619
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:29,720
paroxetine, here we have a comparison with

620
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:34,240
lorazepam.

621
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:37,919
Um, and here maybe later

622
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,919
sertraline will appear

623
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:43,840
and everywhere we have either generalized

624
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,519
anxiety disorder, here we have

625
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,840
co-occurring

626
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:49,679
depression with anxiety disorders.  Here

627
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,679
we have

628
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,030
anxiety,

629
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:57,359
sleep disorders

630
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:57,359
[Music]

631
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:02,880
and the impact on anxiety disorders

632
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:06,640
 

633
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:09,320
when comparing different interventions,

634
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:12,320
right?  So the purple dot means

635
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:17,840
lavender oil.   The

636
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:21,200
blue triangle we have here

637
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:23,159
shows us the effect of

638
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,960
paroxetine.   We

639
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:28,600
still have lorazepam here, right?  A

640
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:31,159
drug from the benzodiazepine group.  And here we

641
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:33,519
also have a triangle, i.e. a

642
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:35,960
placebo.  And what are we examining here?  We have

643
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:39,480
various clinical studies, and here we have the

644
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:43,200
Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, right?  And

645
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:45,880
we see what happened, what

646
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,720
the level of anxiety intensity is, so the lower it is, the

647
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:50,240
greater the

648
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:52,559
expected benefit, so to speak, right?

649
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,559
So the anxiety disorders have been

650
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,480
alleviated.  In the first study, a

651
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:58,399
placebo is compared.  You see, here is

652
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,760
lavender oil, here is placebo.  Big

653
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:03,480
difference.  In the second study, where we have

654
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,559
lavender oil and a placebo, the

655
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,679
difference is slightly smaller, but there is still a

656
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:09,440
statistically significant effect.

657
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,120
Next we have another job.  Very

658
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,559
comparable

659
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,480
effects here.  Here is a similar effect,

660
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:19,799
but please note that here

661
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:22,440
lavender oil was compared with

662
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:24,080
pharmacotherapy, i.e. lorazepam,

663
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,480
benzodipine.

664
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,799
Here we have an intervention where

665
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:30,440
placebo, paroxetine, and

666
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:34,080
lavender oil were compared.  And we see that

667
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:36,760
lavender oil won this duel.

668
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,480
And here's F, where there was a placebo and

669
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:40,240
lavender oil.  This particular study

670
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:44,150
probably did not show a

671
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:47,479
statistically significant result.

672
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:47,479
[Music]

673
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,600
Here they also checked what happens

674
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,960
when there is a higher dose.  For

675
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,360
example, will a larger dose cause an

676
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:59,519
oversaturation effect?  Single

677
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:02,360
doses of 320 mg were used.  Well, of course,

678
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:04,200
three drops is not much.  We don't

679
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,600
have much research either.  There are few of them

680
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:09,320
, in fact I saw that there were works

681
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:11,399
where the dose was double 160 mg.  Um,

682
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:14,279
but for an oil like

683
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:17,679
lavender oil, 300 mg a day, that

684
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:22,039
's not a dose that exceeds our, uh

685
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:24,279
, so to speak, uh,

686
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:25,840
safety limits.  Yes.  Um, with

687
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:27,640
such active ingredients as

688
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:31,480
linalool, odstan, lina lilu, we don't have to

689
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:34,000
worry about toxic effects, and 32 mg will

690
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:37,320
be about 10 drops.  Um, I'm just

691
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,840
saying I prefer to put the

692
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:41,679
results of

693
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,480
all these studies in a practical context.  And we see that

694
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,640
this single dose of 320 mg also did not

695
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,679
cause any

696
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,559
side effects, such

697
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:54,399
as a negative impact on driving

698
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:57,080
.

699
00:30:54,399 --> 00:31:01,840
Here is another SSRI drug in

700
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:03,880
combination with lavender oil.

701
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,399
And these three lines show us

702
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:08,519
three types of interventions.  There is lavender,

703
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:10,440
there is sertraline, which is a pharmaceutical.

704
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:12,559
here the drug SSRI, i.e.

705
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,559
serotonin reuptake inhibitor.  And

706
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,960
we can see that these two lines are the closest to each other

707
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:18,960
, which means the effect is

708
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:21,360
comparable.  Dose 50 mg daily.

709
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:26,120
Doses are always important, of course, and

710
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:27,919
here we have a placebo, right?  So as the

711
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:30,880
study progressed, because these lines became

712
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:34,559
more and more separated,

713
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:36,399
the effect of using

714
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:40,120
 

715
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:42,050
both lavender oil and

716
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:44,080
sertraline was more and more visible.

717
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:46,120
[Music]

718
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,880
So this is concrete information, right,

719
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:53,240
showing us what we can

720
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:55,679
expect in people who, let's say,

721
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:57,559
for example, don't want to take an SSRI for

722
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:59,960
some reason, because they might also have a

723
00:31:57,559 --> 00:32:03,240
bad experience with that drug, right?

724
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:06,279
Then there is an alternative,

725
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:08,799
um, which psychiatrists most often

726
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:12,200
don't know about.

727
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:13,480
And this is the source of this work, so

728
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,720
again we are still in the context of

729
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:18,399
anxiety disorders, but since

730
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:21,000
anxiety disorders also co-occur with

731
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:24,240
mood disorders, it

732
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:27,480
is also justified to

733
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:30,760
analyze it in this context.

734
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:34,159
And indeed, there are

735
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:36,240
indications that lavender oil is

736
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,720
used for co-occurring

737
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,240
depressive disorders and

738
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:44,760
anxiety disorders.  And we have work to prove that this

739
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:46,320
dose of 80 mg per day for 10 weeks

740
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:49,679
is equally effective here.  This is

741
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,679
actually a meta-analysis.

742
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:57,039
Um, we have included here, uh, five different

743
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,960

744
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:02,480
placebo-controlled clinical trials.  Um, and this is also where

745
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:05,279
such simple information comes from,

746
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,600
collecting all the works that

747
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:10,240
I also cited a moment ago.  also in

748
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,960
depression and

749
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:16,399
mild and moderate anxiety disorders,

750
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:19,240
we can consider using a dose of 80 mg

751
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:21,039
for a period of 68 weeks.  Based on this

752
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,880
literature, it has been well

753
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:26,919
documented

754
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:31,159
and of course this time is not

755
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:32,840
very long, but it already

756
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:34,960
gives us some clues.  Yes.  We know that this

757
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:36,480
therapy is well tolerated,

758
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,960
safe, has no

759
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,159
side effects, does not cause excessive

760
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:43,880
sedation, improves quality of life, and

761
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:45,720
improves sleep quality in these

762
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:50,159
patient groups.

763
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:54,080
[Music]

764
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:58,720
Now we're going to navigate a little bit about

765
00:33:54,080 --> 00:34:00,360
anxiety related to

766
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,240
medical procedures.

767
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:04,840
And here, the first thing that comes to mind

768
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:07,639
for most people is problems

769
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:12,960
with dental procedures.  This is an

770
00:34:07,639 --> 00:34:14,599
Indian work from 2016, where a

771
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,280
very simple procedure was used:

772
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:19,079
aromatherapy fireplaces.  Today, they are

773
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,000
often said to be so

774
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:23,560
bad because they heat the oil there.

775
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,200
This is a bit tongue-in-cheek.  This

776
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,359
is not entirely true.  This is a different

777
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,520
type of dispersion of oil molecules.

778
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:32,520
Here, the main emphasis is on

779
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:35,399
the molecules, because when we use diffusers, we

780
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:38,119
create a mist, sonic diffusers, and

781
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:39,760
here we have an effect that causes

782
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:42,200
these molecules to disperse quite evenly

783
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,599
in the air.  We don't have this

784
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:49,679
humidification effect because there is little water

785
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:52,240
in this fireplace, but the effect here

786
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:55,399
will also be different.  And for example, for people who are

787
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:57,000
hypersensitive to moisture, the fireplace is perfect

788
00:34:55,399 --> 00:34:59,359
.

789
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,560
group of 100 patients.

790
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:05,760
Well, it's not surprising that

791
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:10,680
lavender oil will relieve anxiety

792
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,680
before dental treatment.   So

793
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:16,760

794
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,839
this information is more of a

795
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:22,119
confirmation of what we know from

796
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:23,560
our own experience.  And here

797
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:24,960
is a meta-analysis, because it was a

798
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:27,280
single study showing more or less

799
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,320
how it can be done.  We do

800
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,000
aromatherapy even in a very simple way

801
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:33,240
 

802
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,640
like using an aromatherapy burner

803
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:37,000
and it works, and it's interesting that

804
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:40,760
we have a meta-analysis here where

805
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,760
various studies were included and here this

806
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:45,400
aromatherapy burner was often

807
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:47,480
used.  We see three

808
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:50,079
clinical studies where an aromatherapy fireplace was used

809
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:52,280
.

810
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:54,760
To the previous slide, of course,

811
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:57,079
please go ahead.

812
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:58,520
This is the literature source for the table

813
00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:01,680
I showed you a

814
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:03,720
moment ago.  So we have the result of this

815
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:07,680
meta-analysis that aromatherapy is

816
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:11,000
effective in reducing disorders

817
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:13,680
like anxiety, restlessness, associated with

818
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,920
dental procedures.  Yes, we have it

819
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:20,599
uh, pretty well analyzed already.

820
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,680
Um, this was determined precisely

821
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:27,119
using various questionnaires, right?  Um,

822
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:28,440
for example, uh, here can oils be

823
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,280
heated, and does it change their

824
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:32,599
composition?  Well, let me just remind you that

825
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:34,240
oils are in most cases

826
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:35,800
produced by steam distillation

827
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,800
, so they have already been heated

828
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:41,680
quite strongly and thoroughly.  Yes, they had to

829
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:43,960
boil, because in order for the water vapor

830
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,160
to turn into a volatile phase, so that

831
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:48,040
water vapor appears, the water must

832
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,040
boil.  Of course, there are also different

833
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:52,280
distillation methods.  There is steam distillation

834
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,760
, there is hydrodistillation.  Either way

835
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:56,599
, the temperature there is always very high

836
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,720
and it already changes our

837
00:36:56,599 --> 00:37:00,640
chemical composition.  Especially since sometimes

838
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,640
we expect this, this lineup change.  For

839
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,240
example, how is

840
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,800
hamazzulen created, it is not

841
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:09,560
originally present in the essential oil.  it is the

842
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,040
product of reactions occurring during the

843
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:15,560
distillation process.  So, one

844
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:19,880
note.  But when it comes to

845
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:22,880
these safety topics, the

846
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:24,800
key rule is that we do not burn the

847
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,119
essential oil.  Yes, because burning

848
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,359
essential oil will actually cause

849
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:30,560
significant changes.  When we have an

850
00:37:28,359 --> 00:37:33,839
aromatherapy burner where

851
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:36,880
we put essential oil on the surface of the water

852
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:38,960
, the water heats up,

853
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,160
but it doesn't boil, right?

854
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,359
This is a lower temperature

855
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:45,520
and this oil simply by force, so to

856
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:47,760
speak, is on the very

857
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,079
surface, so it is also in the

858
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,880
layer that is not heated as strongly

859
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:53,800
.

860
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,400
And I'm also inspired by

861
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,119
information from Robert

862
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:59,160
Tiserand's course, or the information

863
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:01,640
I heard from

864
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:04,640
Professor Antoni Szumny, because at the

865
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:07,760
university they also researched these oils diffused in aromatherapy fireplaces,

866
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:11,640

867
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:15,440
and the information coming from these sources is that this

868
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:17,119

869
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,440
negative view of

870
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,680
aromatherapy fireplaces is overrated.  I always explain it

871
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,240
this way: it is a different type of

872
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:25,640
aromatherapy

873
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:28,520
than diffusing essential oils in

874
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:31,720
diffusers, ultrasonic ones, of course.

875
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:33,960
So we adapt it more to

876
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,680
our own individual needs and

877
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,200
preferences.   It

878
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,599
is important not to burn this

879
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,280
Turkish oil.  Now a question about

880
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:43,880
citrus fruits.  Citrus fruits are not always produced

881
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:47,079
by distillation.  If we have

882
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:49,720
bergamot free of furanumarins, i.e.

883
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:51,160
FCF oil, then of course it

884
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:53,560
is most often a product of

885
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:56,200
steam distillation, because fumarines are

886
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:57,760
heavy and there are much less of them.  Which does

887
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,440
not mean that they do not contain

888
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,640
bergapten or psolaren at all.  First of all,

889
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,400
bergapten is in bergamot.

890
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:05,960
However, there is much less of it.

891
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,319
then these pipes fall very hard on us

892
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,760
.

893
00:39:07,319 --> 00:39:11,599
And of course, we have citrus fruits both

894
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:14,079
distilled and pressed.  Pressed

895
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:16,720
citrus oils will

896
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:18,960
also contain other ingredients.

897
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:21,000
especially because they will have a

898
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:24,160
more yellow color, because carotenoids also come

899
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,359
there, and a lot of

900
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,760
things come there, so when it comes to

901
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:31,760
citrus fruits, I recommend organic standards again,

902
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:34,200
because pressing also means

903
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,319
that pesticides on the peel

904
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,920
will naturally pass into the

905
00:39:36,319 --> 00:39:39,440
essential oils, so there will be less of these pesticides

906
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,839
in those produced

907
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,160
by distillation.  But why the question

908
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:45,119
about citrus?  Well, because they are actually

909
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,480
less stable.

910
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,079
Why?  because they have a chemical composition that is

911
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:51,040
 

912
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:53,359
very rich in

913
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:55,920
limonene.  Limonene, if

914
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:58,119
we look at the formula, we see a

915
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,240
double bond, which is an

916
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:02,240
unstable bond,

917
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,880
meaning it can be easily oxidized.  Yes?  That's why

918
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:08,359
citrus fruits oxidize easily, because there is a lot of this

919
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:10,480
unsaturated component, this

920
00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:13,400
double bond in this

921
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:15,800
mixture, for example 95%, and this

922
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:17,839
causes this substance

923
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,720
to oxidize easily.

924
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:22,200
That's why

925
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:24,800
we're here, well, let

926
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:26,319
me put it this way, you

927
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,760
use these oils for a shorter time, and then they start to

928
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:32,400
resinate, so the cap sticks, we can

929
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:35,960
also use citrus fruits from the fridge here, of course

930
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:39,280
.  In practice, these

931
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:42,520
medications simply have a shorter shelf life and

932
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:45,400
we try to use them up as quickly as possible,

933
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:47,280
because you will see organoleptic changes quite quickly

934
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,280
 

935
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,240
when using citrus fruits intensively.

936
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,640
But does it matter for the fireplace?  Well, I don't

937
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:59,480
think it matters much.

938
00:40:53,640 --> 00:41:01,200
Um, so I think you can go by the fact

939
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:03,280
that citrus fruits are more sensitive because there

940
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:08,960
's so much limonene

941
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:10,480
and distill and then use them with an

942
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,160
ultrasonic diffuser for example.  Or can

943
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,839
I honestly say that at some

944
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:18,520
point I became very familiar

945
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:21,440
with analog aromatherapy, meaning I use

946
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:23,480
various types of very simple

947
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:26,359
solutions and this is

948
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:29,160
personal aromatherapy, right?  So, I guess everyone already

949
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:30,680
knows my scented woods,

950
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,400
which I actually use

951
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:34,400
most often on a daily basis when

952
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,079
I'm working on the computer.

953
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:40,079
I have such a piece of wood very close to me, almost under my

954
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:42,400
nose, and I use the pieces of wood,

955
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:46,119
I use the shawls for aromatherapy.  I do

956
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:48,480
n't need scented jewelry.

957
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:50,640
I don't need any heating,

958
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,800
fiddling, or washing of this

959
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:55,119
ultrasonic diffuser, because it has to be washed.  Water is

960
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:58,000
known to be an environment for

961
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:59,640
the development of microorganisms.

962
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,920
So this is the most convenient solution for me

963
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,839
.  Of course, if we want to

964
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,800
introduce greater intensity, because

965
00:42:02,839 --> 00:42:05,839
we want, for example, to have an

966
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:08,280
aromatherapy effect on a larger number of people, but to make it

967
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:10,160
more intense, then

968
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:12,800
actually diffusion, or

969
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:15,319
fireplaces, or various types of

970
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,560
nebulizers,

971
00:42:15,319 --> 00:42:19,559
or some aroma stones, can be

972
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:22,119
heated, for example.  So there

973
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:23,559
are a lot of possibilities for this active

974
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:25,680
aromatherapy, but for

975
00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:27,760
everyday use,

976
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,559
but also for example in the bathroom, you can

977
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,000
use

978
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:34,119
very low-intensity aromatherapy, because it's a small

979
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,880
room and it will work there too

980
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:38,040
.

981
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:41,160
So that's how I would comment on it, but if

982
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:42,440
someone wants to use citrus in a fireplace, I would

983
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,620
n't be so

984
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:46,559
concerned.

985
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:47,839
[Music]

986
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:50,800
Okay, here's a summary of the

987
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:53,440
results from the Indian study that

988
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:56,480
I mentioned a moment ago, so this

989
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:58,520
scented fireplace, yes, in the office or in

990
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:01,280
front of it, it was a

991
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:04,040
dentist's waiting room, and we see a big difference

992
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:07,920
between the intervention group and the

993
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:10,440
control group in terms of the severity of

994
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,000
anxiety.  In fact, this difference is

995
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:13,640
visible every time, except for

996
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,520
one job.  Here we have a slight

997
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:18,760
difference.  There is a difference,

998
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:20,680
although it is in favor of aromatherapy, but

999
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:25,520
it is

1000
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:27,040
statistically insignificant.  Pi less than 0.05

1001
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,480
is a statistical entity for us.  And here

1002
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:32,680
everywhere, in every other case,

1003
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:34,280
this value is indeed desirable, and it was

1004
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:37,000
especially low

1005
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:40,440
in this study, which

1006
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:45,000
was just described in detail

1007
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:47,119
on the slide.  It was dentistry

1008
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,800
and lavender is being researched in every, every

1009
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:51,480
way possible.  However, always in

1010
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,839
second place, when it comes to

1011
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:55,960
anxiety disorders and the literature we

1012
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:57,520
know about them, it is worth mentioning

1013
00:43:55,960 --> 00:44:00,119
citrus fruits right away.  Here, for example, there is

1014
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:03,280
grapefruit oil in the

1015
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:05,880
context of colonoscopy

1016
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:08,480
and there is the Osmanthus

1017
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:10,160
Fragrance oil, but it is little known

1018
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:13,280
and it was also used here in smaller

1019
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:15,839
quantities.  uh, there was also a large group of

1020
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,680
lavender, but from what I remember, uh,

1021
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:22,000
this lavender didn't turn out so uh,

1022
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:23,720
positively.  Uh, there was diffusion here, uh,

1023
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,440
probably just such an

1024
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:30,800
ultrasonic diffuser uh, during the

1025
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:32,520
colonoscopy procedure.  And again, if someone

1026
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,160
works in a hospital, then of course

1027
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:36,119
they could use this information

1028
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:38,599
immediately in practice.  Yes, it is a

1029
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:40,680
non-invasive method.   It

1030
00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:43,119
will be more pleasant for everyone.  Of course,

1031
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:46,200
when it comes to aromatherapy, the

1032
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:48,200
first key issue is always the

1033
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:50,960
hedonistic pleasure response.  So

1034
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:53,160
if you decide to undergo aromatherapy, the

1035
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:57,119
person who is undergoing this

1036
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:58,839
treatment must have good

1037
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,720
experiences with this scent.  Because if

1038
00:44:58,839 --> 00:45:03,359
someone doesn't like lavender and we

1039
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:06,000
force it on them because it will calm you down,

1040
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:08,280
it may have an effect, we may achieve the

1041
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,920
opposite effect to the one intended.

1042
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:13,319
So, a pleasure.  Rule number one, the

1043
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:15,240
hedonistic rule in aromatherapy,

1044
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:18,040
always applies to us.  Why am I talking about this?

1045
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:19,760
Because we remember what

1046
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:23,440
I talked about at the beginning, about the durability of

1047
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:26,839
olfactory memory, about the contextual

1048
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:29,960
meaning of slowing down, right?  So,

1049
00:45:26,839 --> 00:45:31,640
the smell that accompanied a specific

1050
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,240
situation will remind us of that situation

1051
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:35,440
.  If someone has had very

1052
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:38,079
negative, difficult,

1053
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,160
traumatic experiences and was also using

1054
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:41,480
lavender oil, then the lavender

1055
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,480
simply won't work for them and all these

1056
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:45,880
tests can be thrown away.

1057
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:47,480
Yes, it won't work for this person.  So we

1058
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:50,000
always have to remember this in the

1059
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:52,640
context of aromatherapy, and of course

1060
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,240
we also use it later, we can

1061
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:57,680
use this anchor that I mentioned at the

1062
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:59,240
beginning, but also always the individual

1063
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:01,200
reaction, especially when it comes

1064
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:03,440
to this aspect of psychological reaction,

1065
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:07,400
is for us a key

1066
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:09,240
pillar of our decision about what we

1067
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:12,079
recommend to whom.

1068
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:14,359
Here we have wisdom teeth removal and

1069
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:17,559
citrus fruits again.  I said, citrus fruits, lavender, these

1070
00:46:14,359 --> 00:46:21,160
are very common case studies from

1071
00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:23,640
clinical trials where effectiveness has been demonstrated

1072
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:26,520
and this time we also have

1073
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:29,680
measured parameters of

1074
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:30,839
sympathetic nervous system activity, yes, i.e. the stress axis.

1075
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:34,040
I was talking about this in the context of the

1076
00:46:30,839 --> 00:46:36,440
polyphagous theory, in the context of the triune

1077
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:40,359
brain, that's how it all connects here.

1078
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:42,839
So we have an influence on blood pressure,

1079
00:46:40,359 --> 00:46:47,920
breathing rate, and

1080
00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:50,400
pulse.  Yes.  And generally

1081
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:53,359
the effects were as follows, and here

1082
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:56,319
they analyzed what was happening during the

1083
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:59,079
individual phases of the procedure.  Yes,

1084
00:46:56,319 --> 00:47:00,920
initially we see that the patients'

1085
00:46:59,079 --> 00:47:04,359
 

1086
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:06,440
blood pressure increased here.

1087
00:47:04,359 --> 00:47:09,000
Here is the fragrance of the grave no fragrance.

1088
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:11,559
So when we look at this data,

1089
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,680
we see that

1090
00:47:11,559 --> 00:47:16,720

1091
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:20,319
blood pressure increases with each subsequent stage.  Here we have the

1092
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:22,760
pulse.  Likewise, it grows and the

1093
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:26,040
respiratory rate also increases.  But we see

1094
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:28,200
that in the group that did not have, or

1095
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:30,920
that did have, aromatherapy, the effects are

1096
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:35,440
different, right?  These values ​​do not increase that much

1097
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:38,960
.  Here 95 in the fifth stage, yes,

1098
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:41,040
beats per minute, and here we have 104.

1099
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:43,280
And we always look at the pi value, right?

1100
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:45,440
So if it is high, we do not have a

1101
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,680
statistically significant result, but

1102
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,119
here there is definitely

1103
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:50,400
statistical significance.  There is statistical significance here

1104
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:52,800
.   There

1105
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,960
is statistical significance here.  Here, here,

1106
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,680
here, it won't be here, no.  Here we have it too

1107
00:47:54,960 --> 00:48:00,240
high, there we have it too high.  Yes,

1108
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:05,000
we have too high here too.  So generally, the

1109
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:08,160
further in the l, the further, so to speak, the

1110
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,640
wisdom tooth removal procedure progressed,

1111
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,400
we know what it looks like in practice, that at

1112
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:13,640
the beginning, okay, it will be okay, but

1113
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:16,559
later when the action begins, the

1114
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:18,359
blood pressure, breathing rate, pulse

1115
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:22,440
accelerates significantly.  And what

1116
00:48:18,359 --> 00:48:26,400
was particularly visible at this stage was the

1117
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:27,880
effect of aromatherapy.

1118
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,880
[Music]

1119
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:32,640
Colonoscopy.

1120
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:35,079
Here it is

1121
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:39,119
Neroli.  Previously there was grapefruit,

1122
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:42,119
here we have Neroli oil, and similarly this

1123
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:42,119
was also analyzed, this

1124
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:48,000
 

1125
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:52,559
experience of anxiety, but also the

1126
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:54,280
effect on blood pressure was analyzed.

1127
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:56,440
Interestingly, no effect was shown here

1128
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:59,440
in terms of the severity of

1129
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:59,440
anxiety.

1130
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:06,200
However, it was noticed that the use of this

1131
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:08,640
neroli oil

1132
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:13,319
resulted in a reduction in systolic

1133
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:15,920
blood pressure in the group undergoing the

1134
00:49:13,319 --> 00:49:19,680
intervention.

1135
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:22,559
It is described in detail here.

1136
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:24,520
One drop and here is a kind of

1137
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:25,920
literary source.  This is a publication

1138
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:27,760
translated from Chinese into

1139
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,920
English.  Of course, I don't remember

1140
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:33,280
where I found it, whether in PubMed or

1141
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:35,359
Google Scholar.  In any case,

1142
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:37,520
there is an error in the text.  It is probably due

1143
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:40,799
to the fact that during the translation

1144
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:42,160
milliliters were incorrectly

1145
00:49:40,799 --> 00:49:44,240
converted, i.e. microliters were

1146
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:46,400
incorrectly converted to milliliters, I

1147
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:48,559
suspect.  So one drop here

1148
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:50,240
was estimated to be 50

1149
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:53,119
microliters.  I assume this was the

1150
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:55,839
authors' intention, although 50

1151
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:58,079
microlitres is not the weight of one

1152
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:59,599
drop of oil, but the weight of one drop of

1153
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:01,960
water.

1154
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:04,720
Oils have a different density than water,

1155
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:08,880
lower, and therefore one drop

1156
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:11,960
will weigh less.

1157
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:13,640
Anyway, 5 minutes of exposure.

1158
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:17,000
These were masks.  Well, they often

1159
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:19,839
appear in research.  then they

1160
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:22,000
isolate the patient from the environment and this is a

1161
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:24,400
more precise

1162
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,520
aromatherapy

1163
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:29,160
and there was no statistically significant

1164
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,839
difference in the level of anxiety before and after the

1165
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:32,440
procedure or the intensity of pain during the

1166
00:50:30,839 --> 00:50:35,000
procedure between the group on the farm and the

1167
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:37,760
control group, but a significant

1168
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:41,000
reduction in systolic blood pressure was noted after

1169
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:43,000
inhalation.  a fragment was cut off here.  I don't

1170
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,160
know why the

1171
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,920
entire presentation isn't visible, but

1172
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:48,900
it's

1173
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:50,359
some kind of program error.

1174
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:52,319
[Music]

1175
00:50:50,359 --> 00:50:55,480
Of course, the entire slide

1176
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:57,520
will be visible on the downloadable PDF slide

1177
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:59,799

1178
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:02,359
.

1179
00:50:59,799 --> 00:51:04,520
And here we see in detail what it

1180
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:08,480
looked like in practice.  the study was not

1181
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:10,240
large.  We can see, marked in yellow,

1182
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,200
especially those values ​​that have

1183
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:14,280
decreased significantly,

1184
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:18,040
and

1185
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:20,119
systolic pressure has decreased the most.  Yes, here is the average

1186
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:21,920
for the control group, and here is the average

1187
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:25,280
for the neroli group.  Well, we see quite a big

1188
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:28,720
difference, right?  Here we have 119,

1189
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:31,079
and here we have 141.

1190
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:35,960
Yes, this is blood pressure yyy with

1191
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:39,040
the letter B, so yyy it was

1192
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:42,440
probably like this after aromatherapy, so

1193
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:45,520
the difference is big, the result is statistically significant, so

1194
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:46,920

1195
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:50,280
here we also have a result that is

1196
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:53,440
statistically significant, only

1197
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:55,920
the difference is smaller and we see here 138 systolic

1198
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:58,400
pressure, but this time at the beginning, and

1199
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:00,400
then a little bit in the neroli group.

1200
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,799
lower 121

1201
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:04,839
and we still have diastolic blood pressure,

1202
00:52:02,799 --> 00:52:07,000
right?  So there

1203
00:52:04,839 --> 00:52:09,240
is also a difference in diastolic pressure between one group and the other

1204
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:15,160
.  Of course, in the group with neroli this one

1205
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:15,160
is worth this parameter lower.

1206
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,480
[Music]

1207
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,480
Yeah.
